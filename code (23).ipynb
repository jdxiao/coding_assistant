        "\n",
        "1. **v1_basic** produced a correct solution with basic inline comments, but the clarity and structure of the explanation were minimal.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **v2_docstring** generated a function that included both meaningful docstrings and well-placed inline comments. The output was highly readable and aligned with educational goals.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Prompt structure significantly influences the format and clarity of the model’s output.\n",
        "- The **docstring-based prompt** (`v2_docstring`) achieved the best balance between explanation quality and code clarity.\n",
        "- Multi-stage prompts like `v3_plan_then_code` can be useful for instructional settings, but may require additional post-processing.\n",

        "v2_docstring generated the highest number of inline comments, with a total of 21, indicating that explicitly instructing the model to include “detailed docstrings and inline comments” has the strongest influence.\n",
        "\n",

        "Prompting with clear emphasis on commenting behavior—especially using terms like \"inline comments\" or \"docstrings\"—leads to more structurally annotated code. In contrast, vague or planning-oriented prompts do not effectively encourage the model to comment its code."

        "## Final Analysis and Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we explored various prompt engineering strategies using StarCoder2 models to generate code solutions for LeetCode-style problems. We compared three prompt variants:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **v1_basic**: A simple instruction requesting commented Python code.\n",
        "- **v2_docstring**: A docstring-focused format encouraging inline documentation.\n",
        "- **v3_plan_then_code**: A structured approach asking for a planning step before code generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "We also implemented a **self-refinement** module, which takes the model's initial output and regenerates an improved version based on its own code and a fixed prompt template.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Observations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The **plan-then-code** prompt (`v3`) generally produced more structured and readable code, especially when coupled with the self-refinement process.\n",
        "- The **docstring prompt (`v2`)** resulted in code with the highest average comment density.\n",
        "- The **self-refinement step** consistently improved the quality of comments, fixed formatting issues, and added missing logic steps in many cases.\n",
        "- Visualizations confirmed that different prompts yield noticeably different levels of explanation and code quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt design has a direct impact on both code correctness and explainability. Moreover, enabling models to revise their own output through self-refinement can meaningfully improve clarity and documentation. This demonstrates the potential of combining prompt engineering with feedback-driven refinement in building intelligent educational coding assistants.\n"
